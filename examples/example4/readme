This will simulate a hermaphroditic hybrid population that includes complex selection including DMI's and individually adaptive loci.

Here we consider only two chromosomes each of length 1 morgans.
Notice that specifying '-h' on the command line below will create a hermaphroditic population.
This population will be initially 40% ancestry 0 and 60% ancestry 1. 
For the first 10 generations, this population experiences gene flow from ancestral populations at rates 0.05 and 0.1.
