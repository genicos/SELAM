This is README file for this simulation example. It will provide an outline for the functionality of each file. In order to run the simulation, you may use the command line: 

<executable> --dem example1_demography.txt --output example1_output.txt	

This example gives the framework for a basic simulation for a single, symmetrical population without selection. The demography file (example1_demography.txt) specifies a single population of 2000 individuals (1000 males and 1000 females), initially made up of equal amounts of ancestral population one and two. The initial demography can be seen in the “0” column.  In each subsequent column, 1 and 10, the migration specifications alter. From generation 1 until generation 10, there is no migration from either ancestral population to the new population; after generation 10, ancestral migrants will fill 4% of the new individuals in the population, the remaining 96% will be new offspring from population “0.” 

The output file will instruct the program to output 100 female individuals chosen randomly from the population after the 30th generation; the data will be stored in a text file named “population1_output.txt.” The female individuals will be represented by ancestry tract information – the output will give alternating segments of each chromosome, organized by ancestry type.
