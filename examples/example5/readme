This will simulate admixture between three ancestral populations. 

The frist two admix immediately, and then during a population expansion, 
there is additional admixture with a third ancestral population. 

This models a single DMI between two loci of varying frequencies 
within the ancestral populations at sites 0.2 and 0.8.
