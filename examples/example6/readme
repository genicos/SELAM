This example demonstrates a use of SELAM wherein each chromosome is uniquely marked. 
This may be useful if, e.g., one intends to study the inheritence of mutations on 
unique haplotypes. It is straightforward to add mutations generated using 
coalescent software to each unique haplotype in the output individuals. 

This example is designed to simulate a founder population 
that expands in a novel environment. 

This population is founded initially by 6 females and 4 males. Notice that each 
individual must be created in a subpopulation prior to use to ensure that each 
of their chromosomes is uniquely labeled. E.g. the first female has chromosomes 
labeled 0 and 1. 

Suggested command line is:

./SELAM -d example6_demography.txt -o example6_output.txt -c 3 2.1 2.4 0.9 -m 0

This will therefore simulate a genome of three chromsomes, with two autosomes of lengths
2.1 and 2.4 morgans, and one X of length 0.9 morgans. Males have no recombination, 
i.e. as in drosophila, hence morgans supplied are half as large for autosomes when 
sex-averaged rates are computed. 

This will output 15 males and 15 females at generations 20, 50, and 100. 

Also notice that because generation 1 is used to produce heterozygous uniquely 
labelled inviduals, this simulation effectively starts at generation 2.
